# Data Professional Survey Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes global survey responses from data professionals to uncover trends in salary, job satisfaction, tools, and career progression. The dashboard transforms raw survey data into clear insights about workforce composition, compensation distribution, and factors influencing professional satisfaction in the data industry.

## Business Problem
Organizations and aspiring data professionals often lack visibility into the skills, education, and tools driving success and compensation in data-related careers. This project addresses that gap by using Power BI to visualize how demographics, education, and career paths relate to salary and job satisfaction across the data domain.

## Analytical Approach
The dataset was transformed and modeled in Power BI using Power Query and DAX to derive KPIs and trend metrics.  
Key areas of analysis included:
- Salary comparison by job title, education level, and region  
- Career switch patterns and job satisfaction measures  
- Preferred tools and technologies among data professionals  

## Dashboards Overview

### Career and Salary Breakdown

Data Scientists and Data Engineers recorded the highest average salaries. Python emerged as the most used programming language, and higher education levels (Master’s, PhD) were linked to stronger compensation outcomes.

### Demographics, Career Switch, and Satisfaction

Many career switchers transitioned into Data Analyst roles. Respondents reported high satisfaction with work-life balance but lower satisfaction with salary progression, especially among those with limited academic credentials.

## Key Insights
- Tech and Finance sectors offer the highest salary potential for data roles.  
- Python continues to dominate as the primary programming language.  
- Remote work, culture, and work-life balance are top job satisfaction factors.  
- Career switchers typically begin in analyst roles and progress into higher positions over time.

## Technical Implementation
Developed in Power BI with data cleaning and transformation performed using Power Query.  
DAX measures were used to compute KPIs for salary averages, satisfaction indices, and demographic distributions.
